# Machine Learning from Scratch

This is a repo that contains various ML algorithms that I've implemented from scratch.

These notebooks follow along the [deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) specialisation I'm undertaking on Coursera. They represent my attempts to recreate a machine learning algorithm from memory whenever I've finished a part of the course. I'm only referencing my own notes in these cases - not the Coursera course code or videos.
